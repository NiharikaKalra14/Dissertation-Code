All analyses were conducted in Python 3.6.8 within a custom JupyterLab kernel on Imperial RDS and HPC cluster. PDKit v1.4.4 was used for feature extraction, alongside protobuf v3,20.3 for compatability with Verily's signal format. Modelling and evaluation used scikit-learn, and interpretability analyses were performed with shap v0.41.0.
